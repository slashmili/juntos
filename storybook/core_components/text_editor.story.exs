          Hi there,
        </h2>
        <p>
          this is a basic <em>basic</em> example of <strong>Tiptap</strong>. Sure, there are all kind of basic text styles you‚Äôd probably expect from a text editor. But wait until you see the lists:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            That‚Äôs a bullet list with one ‚Ä¶
          </li>
          <li>
            ‚Ä¶ or two list items.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Isn‚Äôt that great? And all of that is editable. But wait, there‚Äôs more. Let‚Äôs try a code block:
        </p>
    <pre><code >body {
      display: none;
    }</code></pre>
        <p>
          I know, I know, this is impressive. It‚Äôs only the tip of the iceberg though. Give it a try and click a little bit around. Don‚Äôt forget to check the other examples too.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Wow, that‚Äôs amazing. Good work, boy! üëè
          <br />
